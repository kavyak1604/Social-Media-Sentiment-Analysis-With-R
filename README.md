# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-With-R
# Introduction-To-R
R is a powerful programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization. 
With its extensive library of packages, R is widely used in academia, research, and industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for tasks ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning.
# Problem Statement
In the era of social media, understanding audience engagement through metrics such as likes and
retweets is crucial for content creators and marketers. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the
factors that influence the number of retweets and likes on social media posts. Specifically, we
want to determine:
1. What are the central tendencies (mean, median, mode) of retweets?
2. How do variations in likes and retweets correlate?
3. What relationships can we establish between retweets and other variables (month and
likes) using linear regression?
4. Can we predict future retweets based on historical data?

 This analysis aims to provide insights that could help in optimizing content strategies to enhance
user engagement
# Solution
To address this problem, we used a dataset containing social media metrics, focusing on retweets
and likes.

The following steps outline our approach:
● Data Collection

● Data Preprocessing

● Descriptive Statistics (Central Tendencies,Dispersion Metrics, Skewness and Kurtosis)

● Data Visualization (Histogram, Box Plot, Scatter Plot)

● Correlation Analysis

● Linear Regression Analysis

● Model Diagnostics

● Prediction

● Classical Tests (One-sample t-test, Two-Sample t-Test, ANOVA )
# Data Collection
We utilized a dataset containing social media metrics such as retweets, likes, the month of posting, and other features. The data was imported into R for analysis.

dataset <- read.csv("C:/Users/kavya/Downloads/social_media_sentiment_dataset.csv")

The dataset was imported into R for a comprehensive analysis, with preprocessing steps applied
to transform categorical data and handle any missing values, ensuring consistency and accuracy
in further analyses.
# Data Preprocessing
We converted categorical variables like Month into factors and handled any missing values.

dataset$Month <- as.factor(dataset$Month)

This is an essential step to ensure data quality and to prepare it for effective sentiment analysis.
For this project, the following preprocessing steps were undertaken:

1. Handling Missing Values: The dataset was inspected for any missing values, particularly
in key metrics like retweets, likes, and month of posting. Any missing entries were either filled with relevant statistical values or removed, depending on the context, to maintain data consistency.  
2. Data Transformation:  ○Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables, such as months, were converted into
numerical format where necessary to facilitate analysis.  ○ Sentiment Scores: Where applicable, text data was processed to generate
sentiment scores, converting qualitative expressions into quantitative metrics for
easier comparison and visualization.  3. Feature Scaling: For metrics such as likes and retweets, normalization was applied to
standardize the range and minimize the impact of outliers, thereby improving model
performance.  4. Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure reliable model
evaluation. The training set was used to train the sentiment analysis model, while the
testing set validated its accuracy and generalization.
