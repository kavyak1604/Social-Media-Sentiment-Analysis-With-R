# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-With-R
# Introduction-To-R
R is a powerful programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphical visualization. 
With its extensive library of packages, R is widely used in academia, research, and industries such as finance, healthcare, and marketing for tasks ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning.
# Problem Statement
In the era of social media, understanding audience engagement through metrics such as likes and
retweets is crucial for content creators and marketers. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the
factors that influence the number of retweets and likes on social media posts. Specifically, we
want to determine:
1. What are the central tendencies (mean, median, mode) of retweets?
2. How do variations in likes and retweets correlate?
3. What relationships can we establish between retweets and other variables (month and
likes) using linear regression?
4. Can we predict future retweets based on historical data? \n
This analysis aims to provide insights that could help in optimizing content strategies to enhance
user engagement
